This is the first out of four modules in the data science program newly introduced into the Bachelor programs of the **Biology Department, University of Hamburg**. *Data Science 1* provides first an overview of the topic and program and introduces students into the open-source spreadsheet program *Calc*/*Excel*. The course focuses then primarily on data wrangling and visualization using the programming language **R** and is accompanied with various *swirl*-courses and a selection of case studies.

Course creator and instructor: **Dr. Saskia Otto**
